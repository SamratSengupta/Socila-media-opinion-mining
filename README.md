The objective of this project is to build a model to understand how 'opinions' about a certain topic get formed. In our model of the world, an opinion has two elements:

Abstraction: What the opinion is about, for e.g. an opinion on demonetisation can be 'about a topic' such as 'Digital India', corruption, PM Modi, etc.
Expression: The 'sentiment' of the opinion, i.e. positive, negative or neutral
 

Further, we say that when multiple opinions are shared among people, similar opinions start teaming up, reinforce other similar opinions, and thus become stronger. In other words, people start supporting other people having similar opinions, and as a result, opinions turn into narratives.

 

For example, if a large number of people express an opinion such as 'demonetisation will wipe out corruption in India' (an opinion 'about' corruption and having a 'positive expression'), these opinions attract other similar opinions (via retweets, other similar tweets etc.), and it eventually turns into a 'narrative' - a collective worldview shared by a large number of people.

 

Such narratives become the basis for social cognition. That is, if we are able to identify such narratives on social media, we will be able to understand the common opinions shared by groups of people on a certain topic. Further, we will also know how many people share a particular narrative, the abstraction and expression components of these narratives, etc.
